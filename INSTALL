Installation Instructions
=========================



Normal Installation
===================

Under most circumstances, the following steps should be sufficient for building
and installing mingmond into /usr/:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    make install

Additionally, redhat/init.d.mingmond is provided for RedHat-like systems that
support SysVinit initscripts.  It can be installed with:

    install -o root -g root -m 755 redhat/init.d.mingmond /etc/rc.d/init.d/mingmond




Running the Test Suite
======================

mingmond includes a set of self-tests that use the check[1] testing framework.
If the development files for check are available, the test suite can be run as
follows:

    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --enable-check
    make
    make check
